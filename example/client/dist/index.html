            <!-- 
                1: to make a gql call from an element, include the hx-gql
                extension via CDN, NPM, or a downloaded and included copy
                pointed to via a path in a <script>'s "src" attribute and
                add the hx-ext attribute to the desired element with the
                value set to "hx-gql"

                2: for each gql call, specify the handler to handle this
                result of the call to the gql server; this handler just
                needs to return HTML rendered using the result of the gql
                call. this can be done with WASM components (with something
                the Extism plugin system), simple string interpolation like 
                the example above, or any other means of returning a rendered
                HTML fragment

                3: define which query you would like the gql call to make (which
                the result of will then be passed to the specified handler) by
                setting the "query" attribute value equal to the key of the desired
                registered query (see "registerQuery example in script above").
                Registered queries can be either queries or mutations.

                4: if your query requires values to be passed for variables (such as
                the $language variable in the above "hello" gql query), use the 
                "vars" attribute, with whitespace seperated key:value pairs. It works
                just like the "include-vals" extension, thus computed values can also
                be obtained. NOTE: these values will be evaluated using JavaScript's
                'eval' built-in function, so the value of the "vars" attribute should
                always be sanitized before being updated to prevent any unsafe code 
                being executed by your web page
